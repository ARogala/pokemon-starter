				<p>Whenever Pikachu comes across something new, it blasts it with a jolt of electricity. If you come across a blackened berry, it's evidence that this Pok√©mon mistook the intensity of its charge. It occasionally uses an electric shock to recharge a fellow Pikachu that is in a weakened state.</p>
